title: Build Hobbyst Xkcd Reader Android App
---
# Bacgkround
Since android introduces Jetpack, I aware lot of my knowledge need to be refreshed.
With this in mind, I start experimenting by set some personal goals:
- Playing with new technology, either from Android or 3rd party library
- Model application to suit my taste
- Find useful library, pattern, and tools

# Personal Requirements
To make this experiment success, I need to set some limitations:
- should simple enough (fetch, save, and show) with little business
- human accessbility tools friendly 

# Theme
Note: it is hobbyst application and never intended to claim part of or any relation with Xkcd.
Xkcd has provided API that we could use. 

# Design Application
Main responsibilty of this application shows comic strips then reader should see it when coming to application.
